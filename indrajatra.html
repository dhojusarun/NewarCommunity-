  <h1 class="heading">Indra Jatra</h1>
  <p class="description">
Indra Jatra, also known as Yenya, is the largest street festival in Nepal. It takes place in Nepali Bhadra month (August to September in Solar Calendar) and lasts for eight days. Following Gai Jatra, Indra Jatra festival is celebrated by Nepalese to pray to Indra and Dagini for a good harvest and commemorate the deceased in the past year. On the last day, the flagpole erected at Kathmandu Durbar Square will be burned down, which signifies the end of Indra Jatra festival. According to legend, Indra, the god of rain, once descended to Kathmandu valley to steal a certain flower for his mother, Dagini. Since nobody knew his identity, Indra was imprisoned like a common thief. The elephant searched through the streets and alleys of Kathmandu but failed to find his master. Indra's mother was so worried and came down to earth. After revealing themselves to the masses, the captor gladly released Indra. In return, Dagini promised to do two things. One is to take those who have died in the last year back to heaven. The other is to spread enough dew throughout the winter to ensure a good harvest. This is the reason why Indra Jatra is celebrated at Kathmandu, Nepal.
<br>
Yenya Festival consists of two parts, namely Indra Jatra and Kumari Jatra. The celebrations of Indra Jatra include the flagpole ceremony, blood sacrifice, displays of Bhairava's masks, etc. During Kumari Jatra, the living goddess will take the chariot to march through the streets of Kathmandu. And Nepalese carry out the traditional masked dances. At the beginning of Yenya, people would hold a solemn ceremony for erecting a flagpole. This carefully-selected pole is about ten meters long and finally set up outside the Hanuman Dhoka in Kathmandu. At the same time, there will be a grand dance ceremony. A series of legends about Indra and the captured scenes will be reenacted through those gorgeous dances. In many temples of Kathmandu valley, buffaloes, goats, roosters, fishes, nuts and other tributes are worshiped to the gods and goddesses. At the end of Indra rituals, those offerings will be distributed to the crowds.
<br>
After erecting the ceremonial pole at Hanuman Dhoka, people would open the screened door of white Bhairava. His horrible face will be displayed in front of Kumari's chariot procession. This grand exhibition takes place only once a year and lasts for three days. You must be amazed at the huge crystal on the masks. In addition to the official displays of Bhairava at Durbar Square, the masks of Bhairava made by the local residents are also packed along the streets and alleys of Kathmandu. It signifies that wherever Goddess Kumari goes, she will be always under the protection of God Bhairava. Home>Nepal Festival>Indra Jatra

Indra Jatra, also known as Yenya, is the largest street festival in Nepal. It takes place in Nepali Bhadra month (August to September in Solar Calendar) and lasts for eight days.

On the last day, the flagpole erected at Kathmandu Durbar Square will be burned down, which signifies the end of Indra Jatra festival. When passing by the white Bhairava mask, the living goddess Kumari has to stop to greet him. After paying respect to Bhairava, the music sounds all over the whole Kathmandu Valley. Hence beer starts to pour from Bharirava's mouth. Nepalese believe that getting a sip of this beer will bring them good luck. And a small goldfish would be put to swim in the beer in advance. The person who gets the fish must be the most fortunate one for it'll bring him good luck for the whole year.
